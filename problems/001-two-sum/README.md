# Two Sum

**Problem Number:** 1  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**LeetCode Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

## Constraints

- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
- Only one valid answer exists.

## Solutions

See the `solutions/` folder for my attempted solutions.

## Notes

- [x] First attempt - Hash Map solution
- [x] Optimized solution - O(n) time complexity
- [x] Edge cases handled - Duplicates, single solution guarantee
