# LeetCode Solutions - My Journey

Hi, my name is Noah. I have been working through as many LeetCode problems as I can, sometimes daily, sometimes weekly, but always at least once a week. My goal is to sharpen my skills in algorithms, data structures, and problem solving. For me, tackling these questions feels like solving puzzles, and it is incredibly satisfying.

I want to climb the rankings, improve my solutions, and keep getting ahead. The truth is, LeetCode feels like a game when you approach it that way. Growing up, I was hooked on video games like GTA Online, Warframe on PC, PlayStation titles, and arcade games. The reason they were so addictive was the ranking systems, competition, and the value you could attach to your name. LeetCode has that same appeal: the drive to improve, compete, and showcase progress.

That is why I commit all my solutions to this repo. A little about me, I am a double major, I have been coding since I was 12, and I truly enjoy building and learning. When you treat life like a game, you cannot afford to lose. You give it your best every time.

**Knowledge is power.**

## Naming Convention

- Problem folders: `{problem-number}-{problem-name}`
- Example: `001-two-sum`, `002-add-two-numbers`

## Solution Documentation

Each solution includes:
- ✅ Problem description and examples
- ✅ Multiple solution approaches (when applicable)
- ✅ Time and space complexity analysis
- ✅ Test cases and results
- ✅ Notes on edge cases and optimizations

## Current Problems Solved

- [x] **001 - Two Sum** (Easy) - Hash Map solution with O(n) time complexity
- [x] **002 - Add Two Numbers** (Medium) - Linked list traversal
- [x] **003 - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** (Medium) - Sliding Window with O(n) time complexity
- [x] **004 - Median of Two Sorted Arrays** (Hard) - Binary Search with O(log(min(m,n))) time complexity
- [x] **005 - Longest Palindromic Substring** (Medium) - Expand Around Centers with O(n²) time complexity
- [x] **006 - Zigzag Conversion** (Medium) - Row-by-Row approach with O(n) time complexity

## Progress Tracking

I'm committed to continuous improvement and documenting my journey. Each solution represents a step forward in my algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.
